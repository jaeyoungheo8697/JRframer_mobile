Add UI sounds effects to your prototypes.

**Note**: It works better in [Framer Web](https://www.framer.com/web/).

You can easily include [Facebook](https://facebook.design/soundkit) and [Google Material Design](https://material.io/design/sound/sound-resources.html#resources) sounds to your frames and trigger them on events. You can use your own sounds files too. You don't necessarily need to write code.


### Usage

#### Sound component (without writing code)

Connect the Sound component to any frame and choose the event trigger and the sound to play from the Sound property select.

#### With Overrides

1. Import `playSound` function and `sounds` object.

```
import { playSound, sounds } from "@framer/ismael.sounds/code/Sounds"
```

* `sounds` is an object of HTML audio elements.
* `playSound(string | HTMLAudioElement)` can play an audio from a path file.

2. Add in the override:

```
export function YourOverride(): Override {
    return {
        onTapStart() {
            playSound(sounds.uiLock)
        }
    }
}
```

or


```
export function YourOverride(): Override {
    return {
        onTapStart() {
            playSound('https://your-sound.com/file.mp3')
        }
    }
}
```

**NOTE:** `onTapStart` event responds before `onTap` event. It's recommended if you want a faster feedback.

### Future

* Add more kits.
* Add more events.
* Add your own audio file.
